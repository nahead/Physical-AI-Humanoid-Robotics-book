## Prompt

Use the following full Feature Specification to generate the plan, tasks, and final implementation. This spec defines the entire Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book with 4 modules, chapter structure, user stories, requirements, and success criteria.

## Response snapshot

Confirmed that `specs/002-ai-robotics-book/spec.md` is the comprehensive feature specification for the project. All subsequent implementation tasks will be guided by this document.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Low (confirmation of existing state).
- 🧪 Tests: None.
- 📁 Files: None directly modified by this command, but confirms existing `spec.md`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Continue with implementation tasks from `tasks.md`.
- 🧠 Reflection: User re-confirmation of the spec indicates readiness to proceed with remaining implementation phases.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment: n/a
